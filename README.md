Dynamic drawing board. Each collaborator gets their own hex color to draw with, and there's a running list of current collaborators.<br />
Drawings fade out dynamically, decreasing in opacity as time passes. Maybe losing 10% opacity every 5 seconds, so drawings would return to totally white after 50 seconds.


Things left to do:<br />

Add list of contributors (names/hex colors) (Jason)<br />
Allow the user to pick the fade rate of the curve (Alec)<br />
GUI/Drawing enhancements, geometrical shapes (Jared)<br />
Various design improvements (Burton)<br />

'Snapshot' image stored in a JSON file, able to be called up by a user.<br />
