Final Project for: <br />
Jason Kiff<br />
Jonah Siekmann<br />
Burton Jaursch<br/>
Alec Hayden<br/>
Jared Tence<br/>


Dynamic drawing board. Each collaborator gets their own hex color to draw with, and there's a running list of current collaborators.<br />
Drawings fade out dynamically, decreasing in opacity as time passes. Maybe losing 10% opacity every 5 seconds, so drawings would return to totally white after 50 seconds.


Things left to do:<br />
Add list of contributors (names/hex colors)<br />
incorporate mongodb for storing curve objects<br />
user persistence (?) <br />
comment code for clarity <br />
allow the user to pick the fade rate of the curve(?)<br />
