Final Project for:
Jason Kiff

Dynamic drawing board. Each collaborator gets their own hex color to draw with, and there's a running list of current collaborators.
Drawings fade out dynamically, decreasing in opacity as time passes. Maybe losing 10% opacity every 5 seconds, so drawings would return to totally white after 50 seconds.


Things left to do:\n
Add list of contributors (names/hex colors)\n
incorporate mongodb for storing curve objects\n
function to change color based on opacity\n
allow the user to pick the fade rate of the curve \n
