Final Project for:

Dynamic drawing board. Each collaborator gets their own hex color to draw with, and there's a running list of current collaborators.
Drawings fade out dynamically, decreasing in opacity as time passes. Maybe losing 10% opacity every 5 seconds, so drawings would return to totally white after 50 seconds.
